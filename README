The Bitmap Test Suite 0.7
-------------------------

This project aims to produce a set of test bitmaps that are designed to 
test the boundary conditions of bitmap processing software.

It includes bitmaps of all legal bit depths, both uncompressed RGB 
and RLE compressed bitmaps, and various widths (to test padding).

It also includes an extensive set of unconventional, malformed,
and even malicious bitmaps.

At this time, it does NOT include any JPEG or PNG compressed bitmaps.

Organization
============
The bitmaps are put into two directories: valid and invalid.

The "valid" directory contains bitmap files that all conforming bitmap
processors should be able to process.

The "invalid" directory contains questionable, malformed, or even
malicious bitmaps.  A conforming bitmap processor does not need to
be able to process any of these file, but it should not crash or
leak memory.  A superior bitmap processor will either process these
bitmaps in spite of their flaws or display an informative, accurate
diagnostic if it cannot.

Both directories contain an "index.html" file, which is an HTML
page that describes the purpose of each file.


Web Resources
=============
The project status, as well as the latest version of the bitmap test
suite, is available online at SourceForge:

Copyrights
==========
The Bitmap Test Suite has been dedicated into the public domain.
I did this (instead of licensing it under the BSD or GPL) because I
didn't want any legal concerns to inhibit the testing of software.
