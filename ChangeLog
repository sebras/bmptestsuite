	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add RLE8 bitmap that ends in the middle of a delta escape sequence.
	Add RLE8 bitmap that ends in the middle of a run-length encoding.
	Add RLE8 bitmap that ends in the middle of an absolute mode encoding.
	Add RLE8 bitmap with no end-of-bitmap and no end-of-line markers.

	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add RLE4 bitmap that ends in the middle of a delta escape sequence.
	
2005-04-28 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add RLE4 bitmaps that ends in the middle of an escape sequence.
	Add RLE4 bitmaps with no end-of-bitmap and no end-of-line markers.

2005-04-15 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Fix typos in doc strings.
	Move the 0x0 bitmaps to the "questionable" category.
	Add test cases for when the pixel data is cropped/missing.
	Rename variables from "bitmapdata" to "pixeldata".  I think that "pixel" data is clearer.
	Add a DOCTYPE directive to the HTML which the test logger class generates.
	
2005-04-15 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* README
	Update for the 0.8 release.
	* Makefile
	Add TODO file to the releases.
	* TODO
	Added a TODO that lists the missing test cases for the 0.8 release.
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add test cases for when the palette and color mask tables are 
	cropped/missing.
	
2005-04-15 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Replace occurances of "renderer" with the more generic 
	"bitmap processor" in doc strings.
	
2005-04-11 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Break out the bitmaps into three categories
	(valid, questionable, and corrupt), instead of just two
	(valid and invalid).  This is more sensible since many of
	the bitmaps that were techincally invalid were processed
	by all bitmap processors.  It was misleading having these
	bitmaps grouped with ones that no bitmap processor could
	possibly render.
	
2005-04-11 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a bitmap file that ends in the middle of the FILEINFOHEADER.
	Add a bitmap file that ends in the middle of the BMPINFOHEADER.
	
2005-04-09 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a top-down bitmaps for the following bit-depths: 32,24,8,4, and 1
	
2005-04-04 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a test case for when a 32 bpp image contains 10-11-10 RGB color masks.
2005-04-03 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a test case for when a 32 bpp image contains color masks and
	an "optimal color table".
	
2005-04-02 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Remove semi-colons at the end of lines (a habit from hacking C code).
	Add a test case for when a 32 bpp image contains an "optimal color table".
	I'm not sure what that is, but MS Paint handles it and GTK+ doesn't.
	Fix misspellings of "biCompression" in the __doc__ strings.

2005-03-31 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add bitmaps for various "pels per meter" values.
	Change the default "pels per meter" to 1000 (it was zero)
	Change the default "ColorsImportant" to 0, to indicate all colors are important.
	Add bitmaps for various values of "ColorsUsed" and "ColorsImportant".
	
2005-03-30 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a bitmap whose filename has spaces in it.
	Add a directory with a ".bmp" file extension.

	This includes a representitive set of version 3 bitmaps.
	It also includes an extensive set of invalid version 3 bitmaps.
