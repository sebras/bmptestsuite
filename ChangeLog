	* bmptestsuite.py
	Replace occurances of "renderer" with the more generic 
	"bitmap processor" in doc strings.
	
2005-04-11 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Break out the bitmaps into three categories
	(valid, questionable, and corrupt), instead of just two
	(valid and invalid).  This is more sensible since many of
	the bitmaps that were techincally invalid were processed
	by all bitmap processors.  It was misleading having these
	bitmaps grouped with ones that no bitmap processor could
	possibly render.

	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a bitmap file that ends in the middle of the FILEINFOHEADER.

	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a top-down bitmaps for the following bit-depths: 32,24,8,4, and 1
	
2005-04-04 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a test case for when a 32 bpp image contains 10-11-10 RGB color masks.
2005-04-03 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a test case for when a 32 bpp image contains color masks and
	an "optimal color table".
	
2005-04-02 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Remove semi-colons at the end of lines (a habit from hacking C code).
	Add a test case for when a 32 bpp image contains an "optimal color table".
	I'm not sure what that is, but MS Paint handles it and GTK+ doesn't.
	Fix misspellings of "biCompression" in the __doc__ strings.

2005-03-31 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add bitmaps for various "pels per meter" values.
	Change the default "pels per meter" to 1000 (it was zero)
	Change the default "ColorsImportant" to 0, to indicate all colors are important.
	Add bitmaps for various values of "ColorsUsed" and "ColorsImportant".
	
2005-03-30 David Costanzo <david_costanzo@yahoo.com>
	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a bitmap whose filename has spaces in it.
	Add a directory with a ".bmp" file extension.

	* bmptestsuite.py
	Add a 64000x1 image.
	Add a 1x64000 image.
	Add an uncompressed image with an ImageSize of 0.

 	Create initial public release 0.7.
	This includes a representitive set of version 3 bitmaps.
	It also includes an extensive set of invalid version 3 bitmaps.
